# cybergear_ros2

This repository is for controlling CyberGear servo motors with ROS 2.
Currently, it includes the following packages:

+ [cybergear_driver_core](https://github.com/NaokiTakahashi12/cybergear_ros2/tree/main/cybergear_driver_core)

  This package provides manipulation of CyberGear's CAN frames independently of ROS 2.

+ [cybergear_driver_msgs](https://github.com/NaokiTakahashi12/cybergear_ros2/tree/main/cybergear_driver_msgs)

  This package provides messages used by the cybergear_socketcan_driver.

+ [cybergear_socketcan_driver](https://github.com/NaokiTakahashi12/cybergear_ros2/tree/main/cybergear_socketcan_driver)

  This package provides functionality to operate CyberGear using CAN frame messages.

+ [cybergear_maintenance_tools]

  To use this package, you have to use ros2 run and pass the parameters

  '''ros2 run cybergear_maintenance_tools change_cybergear_id_node --ros-args -p target_id:=126 -p device_id:=127'''

  In this example you change the ID of cybergear motor with id 127 to 126.
  Also remember to start the ros2_socketcan bridge and run ./can.sh with sudo!

  If for some reason this script stops working (like it has for us :/) you can do it manually using cansend!

  ```bash
  cansend can0 077D007F#00000001
  ```
  The command is structured as follows:
  - 07 - command id
  - 7D - new motor id
  - 00 - host id
  - 7F - current id
  - \#00000001 - Data field

+ [usb2can native]
  
  Setup the can controller run: (This must be run everytime reconnecting to the motor)

  ```sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000```
  
  Then
  
  ```sudo ip link set can0 up```

  Then

  ```sudo ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1000```
